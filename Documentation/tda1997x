The NXP TDA19971/19972 are HDMI receiver devices that decode HDMI
input signals and present a configurable parallel video output bus and 
audio output bus.  The internal video bus is 36bits while the output bus
differs per device.  These devices offer High Definition (HD) video resolutions
up to 1080p50/60 or WUXGA and HD audio formats up to 8 channels such as DTS HD
and Dolby True HD. The chips optionally include an HDCP 1.4 engine with
pre-programmed keys stored into an internal NV memory.  Additionally the chips
also supports several HDMI 1.4b options such as 3D formats up to 1080p50/60,
Deep Colors up to 36bpp and extended colorimetry.

The TDA19971 has one HDMI input (HDMI-A) and 24bit output bus and the TDA19972
has two HDMI inputs (HDMI-A/B) and a 36bit video output bus.

Driver Details:
---------------

The chips respond to two i2c slave addresses, the first allows access to
HDMI input, audio, and video status and configuration and the second allows
access to CEC.  

The tda1997x-core driver attaches to the i2c slave that controls the device.
It also manages the 2nd i2c slave for CEC.  The platform data structure
provides details about the desired video output bus configuration and the
desired audio output bus configuration. An ASoC codec driver is also provided
however this is merely a skeleton driver as the audio output format cannot
be changed and is dependent upon the HDMI input signal.  A separate platform
specific device video driver can interact with the core to obtain information
about the video data format which is dependent upon the HDMI input signal.  A
separate platform specific ASoC SoC DAI driver can interact with the core
to obtain information about the audio data format which is dependent upon
the HDMI input signal.
